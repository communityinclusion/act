## Consider each person’s whole life from the beginning of the transition process.
Don’t just plan for employment. Relate those plans to the other activities the individual will engage in, including opportunities to socialize and build relationships. Engage everyone the individual knows, and make sure he or she remains at the center of the process.
 
## Use non-work day supports for skill building and job finding.
The supports provided within your day program can help people build skills, explore interests, and develop a clear plan for integrated employment. Make a concerted effort within this program to engage in volunteer opportunities that build both hard and soft skills. Find recreational activities that build community access skills.

## Make employment everybody’s business by breaking down silos.
Create a more integrated model of service delivery. Break down departmental silos, and make the goal of integrated employment every staff person’s business. For example, residential staff can be involved in the discovery and exploration process, and if trained appropriately, can provide job-coaching supports. At the leadership and organizational level, build a culture where staff people across all departments are considered informal job developers.
