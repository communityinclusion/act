## Identify individuals for whom integrated employment is a priority, and place them first.
You’ll need to create a prioritization system as you begin to move individuals out of the workshop. You might start with the individuals who express the most interest or enthusiasm. Or you can prioritize those who would experience the greatest financial impact, who have the broadest skill set and work history, or who are seen as leaders by others in the workshop and can be encouraging to those who are more cautious.

## Take the time for discovery.
Using a comprehensive, person-centered discovery process will help you uncover each individual’s interests, skills, and passions. This process should include family members, friends, neighbors, and anyone else requested by the job seeker. Each participant will bring their own perspective on the individual, and their own set of personal resources. Immediate family members have the opportunity to learn about employment as well. 

## Use exploration opportunities to broaden interests for employment.
You can use community exploration opportunities to help people develop an employment-related interest. Exploration activities might include workplace tours, where different job roles and responsibilities are identified, or volunteer positions that align with preferences. These opportunities will also give you another lens for understanding job accommodation and support needs.

## Use exploration opportunities to build human and social capital needed for work.
“Human capital” includes job search skill building, such as resume writing, interviewing, and submitting applications. It also involves soft skills, such as workplace etiquette, communication, teamwork, and problem solving, that are critical for employment. “Social capital” includes meeting and socializing with new people, as well as interpersonal skill building, and practicing appropriate conflict resolution in the workplace. Both can be intentionally built through fully inclusive, community-based, individualized exploration activities.

## Apply best practices in job developing and job finding, one person at a time.
You’ll see the best results when you apply the best practices. This means using the job developer’s professional networks, as well as the personal networks of the individual and the planning team. Best practices also included person-centered Discovery and planning, volunteering, informational interviews, time-limited work trials, and other opportunities to ensure a strong job match. This also means offering post-hire supports to ensure ongoing workplace accommodations.
